# work-samples
Centralizing some work samples of mine -- while also protecting sensitive data/info.

This repo is still under construction! :construction_worker_man:

However feel free to browse through what I have done and make sure to check out whatever `Readme` is available for more insight on what the tool does.

Most tools should have a brief description available through their argument parser as well.
